# Security groups

# RDS security group - restricts Postgres access to VPC-internal access only
# EKS node-to-node traffic is handled automatically by the EKS-managed cluster
# security group. ALB controller manages its own SGs when creating load balancers
# via Ingress annotations. Neither needs a manually created SG here.
